# Proposal

Contains code used in my PhD Proposal. The `hospital_sim.R` file contains code for simulating a model of the spread of MRSA in a hospital ward, used in Section 4.1 to generate data for a plot and Section 4.3 to generate data for inference. The `hospital.R` file contains code for performing a data-augmented MCMC algorithm for the previous model, used in Section 4.3 on the previous simulated data.

Both model and inference method are taken from the following paper: Estimating the effectiveness of isolation and decolonization measures in reducing transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospital general wards (Worby et al., 2013).
